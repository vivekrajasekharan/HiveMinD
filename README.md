> As a part of the Insight Data Science Fellowship I consulted for a healthcare company to improve accuracy of online diagnosis of clinical cases.

> I utilized machine learning (Python) & collective intelligence of multiple clinicians to increase the diagnostic accuracy by ~30 %.  My key findings are highlighted in the blog (https://medium.com/collectivemd/collectivemd-bf1a8d0a923a).

> I built an interactive application with flask, to output the probable diagnosis & diagnostic accuracy for a case. The app is also hosted at http://vivekrajasekharan.com/

> Please note, the app is password protected to keep the information secure, please email me at vivekrajasekharan@gmail.com for the password.

> I cannot share the code for this project publicly for the same reason.
